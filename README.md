# Railway-Level-Crossing
A simple application for controlling the gate and traffic light based on 3 sensors located before, at, and after the cross-level to avoid collision between cars and trains. This system comprises three components: sensors, controller, and actuarors (trafffic light and gate). The controller is the brain of the system as it coordinates the movement of the actuators based on the state of the sensors and the previously known location of the train. Hence, this repository mainly focuses on the controller.
